# shopping-list

**Overview:**

An app in which user can create, read, update and delete entities (as an example it can be a shopping list).
As a boilerplate I [took these files](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-projects/tree/master/13-stripe-submenus/setup)

After the app loads user is able to see a list of items that he added previously (even after leaving the app) if any. 
After that user can add/update/delete item(s) using a number of buttons.
Either successfully or unsuccessfully adding/removing/updating the list a small alert message is shown to inform the user about the action that has taken place.

**Technical difficulties:**

* Setting up an alert box and displaying it correctly without any software bugs
* Syncing data with a local storage
* Updating an item
